#TRAINING CELL WEBSITE
We are making a test website that can pause during test after answering question questions will appear one by one only and after answering the question the user can pause the test and attend it at any time of the day he/she pleases . 
One more test feature we wish implement is generating tags for each question eg like dbms tag for a dbms and in the test we can select which tag to start doing first, this would increase their morale as the user can attend the question that are easy to him/her first .
The front end of the proposed design for the website is shown.
